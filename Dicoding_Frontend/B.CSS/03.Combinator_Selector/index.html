    <h1>Combinator Selector CSS</h1>

    <h3 class="adjacent">Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h3>
    <p>
        The rule will be applied to <code>paragraph</code> elements 
        that are immediately after <code>h3</code> elements.
    </p>

    <h3 class="genSibling">General Sibling Selector (~)</h3>
    <p>
        The rule will be applied to all <code>paragraph</code> 
        elements that are positioned after an <code>img</code> element.
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>
            This <code>paragraph</code> is skipped, because has different parrent element.
            This <code>paragraph</code> inside <code>div</code> element.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        This <code>paragraph</code> has been reached.
    </p>

    <h3>Child Selector (>)</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            This paragraf inside <code>div</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The CSS rule will be applied to all paragraph elements that are 
            directly within a <code>div</code> element. In other words, 
            the <code>paragraph</code> element is a child of the 
            <code>div</code> element, not just a descendant.
        </p>
        <section>
            <p>
                <code>Paragraph</code> inside a <code>div</code>, 
                but not as a direct child element.
            </p>
        </section>
    </div>
    <p>
        <code>Paragraph</code> outside <code>div</code> element.
    </p>

    <h3>Descendant Selector (space)</h3>
    <div class="descendant">
        <p>
            The Descendant Selector is similar to the child selector, 
            but its hierarchy is broader because the rule will be applied 
            to all elements that are its descendants, even indirectly. 
            The first basic selector written in this selector becomes the parent, 
            and the second basic selector will apply the rule. 
            This selector uses a space to combine the two basic selectors.
        </p>
