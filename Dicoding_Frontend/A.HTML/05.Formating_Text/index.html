                Binary Beats

        A binary dance, old yet new.

        
        Ebb and flow of digital seas,
        Infinite tales, coded with ease.
            
        Silent whispers, a digital song,
        Where every bit finds its belong.
        A universe within a tiny speck,
        Binary beats, perfect and direct.
            
        On off, yes no, true false rise,
        In this pattern, the universe lies.
        From the vast to whatâ€™s concise,
        Binary is both end and the device.
